# **parcha**

Parcha is a multilingual post medical consultation service whose 
purpose is to ease the process of prescription reading 
for the patient, and provide calculated diet according 
to the diagnosis.




## MY ROLE

The whole process of this project i.e Discovery, Ideation and Design is done and completed by me. It was a solo project.

## RESEARCH

Qualitative research was done for this project. Multiple one on one semi-structured interviews were conducted with ‘Healthcare providers’ and ‘Patients’ to get deep insights. Also observational study was an essential tool in this research as I had to observe and study user behaviours and what problems they faced.

### WHEN?

The timeline on which I worked was from 18th April 2022 - 4th June 2022 that is around 6 weeks.

### WHY?


Patients not able to read their medical prescriptions and not able to remember their medicine schedule given by the doctor and no dietary knowledge in illness.

## Solution

Parcha was developed out of real life situation when I recently visited to a doctor's clinic for a viral checkup. The name of the medicines he wrote in the prescription was totally un-readable, and also after I came home I usually forget about the medication schedule the doctor mentioned and wrote on the prescription.

### Initial Wireframes

Below present are the **lo-fidelity wireframes** done on the tool 'Balsamiq'.
The **lo-fidelity prototypes** were displayed in front of people for testing which led to a positive feedback. The user group selected for usability testing was 'Patients' and following as per the persona people were approached.
