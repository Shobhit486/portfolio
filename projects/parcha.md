### WHAT?

Qualitative research was done for this project. Multiple one on one semi-structured interviews were conducted with ‘Healthcare providers’ and ‘Patients’ to get deep insights. Also observational study was an essential tool in this research as I had to observe and study user behaviours and what problems they faced.

### WHERE?

Geographically the research was done and completed in two cities that is ‘Delhi’ and ‘Jaipur’. I went to multiple hospitals, clinics and healthcare centres to gain access to doctors and patients.

### WHEN?

The timeline on which I worked was from 18th April 2022 - 4th June 2022 that is around 6 weeks.

### WHY?

There were multiple problems extracted from the research that were-
Understandability and readability issues of a prescription.
Language barriers.
No dietary knowledge in illness.

## Solution

This idea was developed out of real life situation when I recently visited to a doctor's clinic for a viral checkup. The name of the medicines he wrote in the prescription was totally un-readable, and also after I came home I usually forget about the medication schedule the doctor mentioned and wrote on the prescription.
