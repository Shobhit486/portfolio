WHO?
The whole process of this project i.e Discovery, Ideation and Design is done and completed by me. I worked on this project solo.

WHAT?
Qualitative research was done for this project. Multiple one on one semi-structured interviews were conducted with ‘Healthcare providers’ and ‘Patients’ to get deep insights. Also observational study was an essential tool in this research as I had to observe and study user behaviours and what problems they faced.

WHERE?
Geographically the research was done and completed in two cities that is ‘Delhi’ and ‘Jaipur’. I went to multiple hospitals, clinics and healthcare centres to gain access to doctors and patients.

WHEN?
The timeline on which I worked was from 18th April 2022 - 4th June 2022 that is around 6 weeks.

WHY?
There were multiple problems extracted from the research that were-
Understandability and readability issues of a prescription.
Language barriers.
No dietary knowledge in illness.
