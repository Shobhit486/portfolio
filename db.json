      "I am passionate about using UX/UI and IxD to design user-friendly products, environments and systems. I use my skills in user research, user testing and prototyping to implement designs. I love solving problems and tackling new challenges. I look forward towards understanding the userâ€™s requirements and perspective in order to create great user experiences.",
      "I am skilled with Figma, Photoshop and InDesign.",
      "I am a master's student of Interaction Design, from JK Lakshmipat University, Jaipur. Before my degree I have been through a 6 month bootcamp UX Jumpstarter course at ImaginXP, which helped me learn the fundamentals of design in the field of user experience. After that my master's gave me the validation that I needed to be a good designer, empathising with users and understanding how to design for people."
